# Agent_based_modeling-of-16-Proteins-inside-a-Cancer-Cell-using-GAMA-Platform
Developed an agent-based model inside a cell to study and explore the behavior of the interactions between the three crucial parts or interplay of cancer development: the metabolism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. This simulation will try to replicate the environment of a tumor cell using the 16 gene or metabolite nodes that will provide a quantitative result and analysis to predict the final cell state and comprehend the mechanisms between cancer and development. The biological network regulation used was based on the Exposing the Underlying Relationship of Cancer Metastasis to Metabolism and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions (2019) by Xin Kang, Jin Wang, and Chunhe Li.
